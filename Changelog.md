### 1.3.2 (12/*/23)
* Added Korean translation, courtesy of 오구리 캡 (oguri_cap_1988). Thank you!
* Removed the underbarrel attachment slot for the Bolt Action Rifle; it was not meant to have this attachment slot in the first place.
* Fixed iron sight position of the Automatic Shotgun.

### 1.3.1 (11/28/23)
* Fixed the Infantry Rifle accepting stock attachments when it's not supposed to. Whoops!

* Added the Rapid SMG, Automatic Sniper Rifle, and Infantry Rifle.
* Overhauled the Hunting Rifle with a new model, sounds, and stats.
* Added the Bolt-Action Rifle, which uses the old model of the Hunting Rifle with reworked stats and some new sounds.
* Added the Pump Shotgun and Chevron Scope, using the Shotgun and Medium Scope models from CGM Audio/Visual Enhancements.
  -  The Chevron Scope has received a new reticle that more closely matches the Long/Ballistic Scopes' reticles.
  -  CGM AVE will be updated with new models for these items to reflect this addition.

* Updated Submachine Gun and Heavy Assault Rifle models.
* Buffed the damage of the Micro SMG to compensate for its high ammo consumption.
* Slightly increased the Double Barreled Shotgun's fire rate to reduce the minimum delay between shots.

* Fixed instances of enchantment glint z-fighting with several models. (Issue #7)
* Possibly fixed a compatibility issue with Rubidium, in which the Dot Sight and Ballistic Scope had glowing textures where there shouldn't be any. (Issue #14)
